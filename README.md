*Solar System Explorer*

A visual and interactive explorer of our solar system, created using only HTML and CSS â€“ no JavaScript required! ðŸš€ðŸŒžâœ¨

Overview
This project visually represents planets orbiting the sun, giving users a stunning and interactive way to explore our solar system. Leveraging simple code and cool animations, itâ€™s perfect as an educational demo or a fun coding showcase.â€‹

Features
Pure HTML structure for the sun, planets, and moons

CSS-based orbits, planetary motion, and elegant glowing effects

Animated planetary revolutions using keyframes and transformsâ€‹

Responsive, dark-themed, and modern space visual style

No JavaScript dependencies â€“ runs in any modern browser

How It Works
HTML elements represent the sun, each planet, and their moons.

CSS controls the layout, orbit paths, and animations using @keyframes and transform. This enables realistic orbits and rotations.

Each celestial bodyâ€™s orbit and appearance are styled for clarity and visual impact.
